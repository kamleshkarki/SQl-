/*
trigger?

A trigger is a special type of a procedure that 'fires' when an event such as INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE occurs occurs
They are regared as 'event-driven specialized procedures', and as such are stored in and managed by the RDBMS
A trigger fires when we modify the data modification to the associated table by suing one of the events INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE
Triggers are primarily used for referential integrity of data. When creating a trigger we attach it to the table
Triggers can be 'nested' in another trigger thereby firing another trigger
Two typs of triggers in this demo. After and Instead Of.
After triggers fire immediately after the event
Instead Of fires preventing the event from happening

Use TSQL
Go
